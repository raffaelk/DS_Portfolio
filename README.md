# Data Science Portfolio
A portfolio with some of my data science projects created for academic courses, self-learning and hobby. 

**NOTE:**  The projects use jupyter notebooks. In case of github having troubles displaying the notebooks just use the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) of jupyter.

# [Project 1: Time Series Classification with Deep Learning](https://github.com/raffaelk/DL_Timeseries_Classification) 

## Content
- Used deep learning to classify time series data.
- Applied a transformer model to time series and compared it to two different convolutional networks.
- Created class activation maps (CAM) to highlight features learned by the convolutional networks.
- Visualized the attention values of the transformer model.

## Main Technologies Used

- Language: Python
- Visualization: Matplotlib
- Analysis and Modelling: PyTorch, NumPy

# [Project 2: Sentiment Classification of Movie Reviews](https://github.com/raffaelk/nlp-basics/tree/main/sentiment_classification)

## Content
- Created a NLP model for sentiment classification of movie reviews.
- Compared a lexicon based approached to a discriminative classifier.
- Built a very simple GUI/API to use the pretrained and saved model in a web browser.
- Prepared a Docker file which can be used to create a Docker image and run the application in a container.

## Main Technologies Used
- Language: Python 
- Visualization: Matplotlib, wordcloud
- Analysis and Modelling: pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK
- Deployment: Flask, HTML, Docker
- Set-Up: Bash

# [Project 3: Topic Classification and Analysis of Newspaper Headlines](https://github.com/raffaelk/nlp-basics/tree/main/topic_classification)

## Content
- NLP analysis of a set of newspaper headlines.
- Performed an extended exploratory data analysis.
- Displayed with graphical and statistical tools how the importance of certain topics and words evolved over time.
- Created a multiclass classification model to classify the headlines into distinct topic categories. 

## Main Technologies Used
- Language: Python 
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Analysis and Modelling: pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK
