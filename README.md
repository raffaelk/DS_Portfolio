# [Project 1: Time Series Classification with Deep Learning](https://github.com/raffaelk/DL_Timeseries_Classification) 

## Content
- Used deep learning to classify time series data.
- Applied a transformer model to time series and compared it to two different convolutional networks.
- Created class activation maps (CAM) to highlight features learned by the convolutional networks.
- Visualized the attention values of the transformer model.

## Main Technologies Used

- Language: Python
- Visualization: Matplotlib
- Analysis and Modelling: PyTorch, NumPy
